# Data_Analysis

Summary: In this project, I demonstrated my expertise in data analysis by working with a large dataset of sales data from an e-commerce platform. I successfully cleaned, processed, and visualized the data to extract valuable insights that can inform business decisions. Through this project, I showcased my ability to work with complex data, identify patterns and trends, and communicate findings in a clear and concise manner.

# Objective of project:

Objective 1: Analyzed sales data to determine the best month for sales and the total sales amount for that month.

Objective 2: Identified the city with the highest number of sales using data visualization.

Objective 3: Determined the best time for sales by analyzing the hour and minute of each sale.

Objective 4: Found the product that is most often sold together with other products using combinations and counter functions.

# Key Skills Demonstrated:

Data Cleaning: I effectively handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected errors in the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Data Processing: I utilized pandas and other libraries to manipulate and transform the data, creating new columns and aggregating data to facilitate analysis.

Data Visualization: I leveraged matplotlib and other visualization tools to create informative and engaging plots that revealed key trends and patterns in the data.

Data Analysis: I applied statistical techniques and data modeling to identify correlations, trends, and insights that can inform business decisions.


# Key Findings:


The best month for sales was December with a total sales amount of 4,80,00,000.

The city with the highest number of sales was SAN FRANCISCO.

The best time for sales was 11am and 19 pm i.e 7 pm.

The product that is most often sold together with other products was iPhone and Lightning Charging Cable.

Business Value: This project demonstrates my ability to extract valuable insights from complex data, providing actionable recommendations for business improvement and growth. By leveraging my data analytics 
skills, I can help organizations make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and drive revenue growth.
