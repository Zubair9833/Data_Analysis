# Data_Analysis

Summary: In this project, I demonstrated my expertise in data analysis by working with a large dataset of sales data from an e-commerce platform. I successfully cleaned, processed, and visualized the data to extract valuable insights that can inform business decisions. Through this project, I showcased my ability to work with complex data, identify patterns and trends, and communicate findings in a clear and concise manner.

Objective of project:

Objective 1: Analyzed sales data to determine the best month for sales and the total sales amount for that month.

Objective 2: Identified the city with the highest number of sales using data visualization.

Objective 3: Determined the best time for sales by analyzing the hour and minute of each sale.

Objective 4: Found the product that is most often sold together with other products using combinations and counter functions.

Objective 5: Identified the product that has been sold the most using groupby and sum functions.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Data Cleaning: I effectively handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected errors in the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Data Processing: I utilized pandas and other libraries to manipulate and transform the data, creating new columns and aggregating data to facilitate analysis.

Data Visualization: I leveraged matplotlib and other visualization tools to create informative and engaging plots that revealed key trends and patterns in the data.

Data Analysis: I applied statistical techniques and data modeling to identify correlations, trends, and insights that can inform business decisions.

Insight Generation: I extracted actionable insights from the data, providing recommendations for business improvement and growth.
